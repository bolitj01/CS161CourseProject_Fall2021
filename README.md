CS 161 Intro to Comp Sci II Course Project - IdleSoles

You are welcome to expand on the project throughout the semester. I will review any pull requests and enhance the project with your feedback. 
Note if multiple students work on the same feature, I may not be able to incorporate everyone's code. 
It may be worthwhile to collaborate on upgrades beforehand.

To work on the project, you must request to be invited as a collaborator.
Once you have access and have written code to submit, you must create a pull request that I will review before accepting any of your code.
