CS 161 Intro to Comp Sci II Course Project - IdleSoles

You are welcome to expand on the project throughout the semester. I will review any pull requests and enhance the project with your feedback. 
Note if multiple students work on the same feature, I may not be able to incorporate everyone's code. 
It may be worthwhile to collaborate on upgrades beforehand.
